# topiccleaner
Deletes unwanted topics from sight in bitcointalk

It is a TamperMonkey script which lets you evaporate certain forum rats which you don't like.  I made this because the forum's own ignore button isn't working well enough.

Once you run both scripts, you won't see the topics they've created, you won't see any spam posts they've made. It is total obliteration. One might even call that a genocide.

How?

Step 1:

Add TamperMonkey to Chrome (or your favorite browser)

Step 2:

Enable developer mode on extensions so our script can work. (we need to do that because google v3 manifestation bla bla bla)

Extensions > Manage Extensions > Enable Developer Mode on Right Top Corner

Step 3:

Open up TamperMonkey dashboard and create new script by clicking the "+" button. Then separately save this script. Edit the "rats" variable and add as many rats as you like. The more the better. Leave none alive.
